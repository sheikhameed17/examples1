        <p>Shanmuga Furnitures Ltd is one of the leading suppliers of
        high quality furniture in East Africa. We are a pioneer in
        the industry offering the market greater choice, innovative
        and ergonomic designs as well as environmentally
        friendly furniture.
        Since Our humble inception in 1969, the group has grown
        from strength to strength. Victoria Furnitures Ltd started
        its establishment on Tom Mboya Street (formerly Victoria
        Street, and hence its name). From the very beginning,
        the group has focused on its core principles of customer
        service, quality, value for money and innovation, and it is
        these principles that have enabled the group to gain the
        trust of customers.<br></br>Today, the group employs over 500 people, operating 2 showrooms and 2 workshops in Nairobi. We also have showrooms in
        Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
        For over 45 years, the Victoria Furnitures group has been active
        in providing furniture that is flexible, dynamic and attuned with
        the global and technological changes. The group continuously
        introduces new and high tech furniture to remain at the forefront of the industry. <br></br>On the manufacturing front, we have continued to invest in
        new technology and machinery to continue its popular
        pace with new designs and styles to suit clients needs. In
        particular, we have invested in post-forming machinery,
        technology to work with CorianÂ® material as well as other
        woodworking machines.
        Having established itself as a market leader for office
        furniture, the group has also continued its growth strategy
        and has developed additional lines that includes Kitchens
        and Wardrobes, Joinery & Fit outs and Custom-Made
        furniture</p>
